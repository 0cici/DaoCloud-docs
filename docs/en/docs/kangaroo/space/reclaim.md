# Image retention

Image retention refers to the process of deleting images and reclaiming the resources used to create those images. When you no longer need an image, you can delete it, which will reclaim the disk space used by the image. This process is called "image retention". By reclaiming images, you can free up disk space for other operations on your system, while also keeping your system clean and optimized.

You can create image retention rules for the current registry space. All image retention rules are calculated independently and apply to all qualified images, with a maximum of 15 retention rules supported.

Click on `Registry space` in the left-hand navigation bar, and click a name in the list.
