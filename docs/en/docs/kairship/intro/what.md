# What is multi-cloud orchestration

Cloud computing in China has been developed for nearly 15 years. With the maturity of technology, enterprise applications are not only simply going to the cloud, but more and more complex multi-cloud requirements have emerged. The development process of cloud computing from single cloud to multi-cloud is briefly shown as follows.

Enterprises have only needed to go to the cloud at the beginning, and now they have started to choose which cloud to use, or which clouds to use, so as to build a multi-cloud environment dedicated to the enterprise itself.

According to statistics, the current multi-cloud ratio when enterprises choose to go to the cloud is as follows:

| Cloud solution | Market share |
| ----------------------- | -------- |
| Multiple public clouds + multiple private clouds | 43% |
| Multiple public clouds + a private cloud | 29% |
| One public cloud + multiple private clouds | 12% |
| One public cloud + one private cloud | 9% |
| A public/private cloud | 7% |

As can be seen from the above table, multi-cloud is the trend and the mainstream of the market. This is how multi-cloud orchestration was born.

Multi-cloud orchestration Kairship (Kubernetes Airship) is an application-centric, out-of-the-box multi-cloud application orchestration platform.
Multi-cloud orchestration realizes the centralized management of multi-cloud and hybrid cloud, and provides cross-cloud application deployment, release, and operation and maintenance capabilities; supports elastic scaling of applications based on cluster resources, and realizes global load balancing; provides fault recovery capabilities, and completely solves the problem. Disaster recovery for multi-cloud applications.
