# workload

After connecting to the working cluster, you can create workloads. Workloads managed by multi-cloud orchestration software can be distributed across clusters and managed by region and availability zone.

!!! note

    Currently, multi-cloud orchestration only supports the creation of stateless workloads (Deployment); if you need to create other resources, you can temporarily use `YAML` to create them.
