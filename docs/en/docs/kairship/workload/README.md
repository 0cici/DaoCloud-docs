# workload

After connecting to the working cluster, you can create workloads. Workloads managed by Multicloud Management software can be distributed across clusters and managed by region and availability zone.

!!! note

    Currently, Multicloud Management only supports the creation of stateless workloads (Deployment); if you need to create other resources, you can temporarily use `YAML` to create them.
