# What is Global Management (Ghippo)?

Global Management (Ghippo) is a comprehensive user-centered service that includes access control, enterprise space, audit logs, platform settings, and other fundamental modules.

- [Access Control](../user-guide/access-control/global.md): Helps users manage access to resources. Users can create, manage, and delete users/groups, and configure user/group permissions to divide users' functional rights flexibly.

- [Enterprise Space](../user-guide/workspace/ws-folder.md): A resource isolation unit with a hierarchical structure and capability of access control. Users can set up a hierarchical structure depending on the development environment, department structure, etc., and control who has access to which resources.

- [Audit Logs](../user-guide/audit/audit-log.md): Provides operation logs of resources that allow security analysis, resource changes, problem location, and other essential insights.

- [Platform Settings](../user-guide/platform-setting/mail-server.md): Platform security policy, mail server, appearance customization, and more ensure secure user information and a personalized experience.
