# Product advantages

**Elasticsearch is fast**

Because Elasticsearch is built on top of Lucene, it does a great job at full-text search.
Elasticsearch is also a near real-time search platform, which means that the delay between indexing a document and making it searchable is as short as one second.
As a result, Elasticsearch is ideal for time-critical use cases such as security analysis and infrastructure monitoring.

**Elasticsearch has the essential characteristics of distribution**

Documents stored in Elasticsearch are distributed across different containers called shards, which can be replicated to provide redundant copies of data in case of hardware failure.
The distributed nature of Elasticsearch allows it to scale to hundreds (or even thousands) of servers and process petabytes of data.

**Elasticsearch includes a wide range of features**

In addition to advantages such as speed, scalability, and elasticity, Elasticsearch has a large number of powerful built-in functions (such as data aggregation and index lifecycle management), which can facilitate users to store and search data more efficiently.

**Elastic Stack simplifies data acquisition, visualization and reporting**

Integration with Beats and Logstash allows users to easily process data before indexing it into Elasticsearch.
At the same time, Kibana not only provides real-time visualization of Elasticsearch data, but also provides a UI for users to quickly access data such as application performance monitoring (APM), logs, and infrastructure metrics.

**Elasticsearch supports multiple programming languages**

- Java
- JavaScript (Node. js)
- Go
- .NET (C#)
-PHP
- Perl
-Python
