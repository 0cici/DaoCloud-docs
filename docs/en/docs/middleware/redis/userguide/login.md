# Use Redis for the first time

Please contact the administrator in advance to perform the following operations after `Container Management` -> `Helm Application`[installed redis-operator](./install.md).

1. Select `Middleware` -> `Redis Cache Service` in the left navigation bar.

    

2. After selecting a workspace in the pop-up window, click `OK`.

    

    !!! note
    
        If the pop-up window does not appear, you can manually click the icon in the upper left corner to select a workspace.

3. When logging in for the first time, you can click `Deploy Now` to create an instance. When you log in thereafter, information such as all Redis instances and their running status will be displayed.
