# Enter the middleware data service for the first time

[Elasticsearch search service](elasticsearch/intro/what.md), [Kafka message queue](./kafka/intro/what.md), [MinIO object storage](./minio/intro/what.md) using DCE 5.0 for the first time .md), [MySQL Database](mysql/intro/what.md), [RabbitMQ Message Queue](rabbitmq/intro/what.md), [PostgreSQL Database](postgresql/intro/what.md), or [Redis Cache Service](./redis/intro/what.md) component, you need to select a workspace. For an introduction to the concept of workspace, please refer to [Workspace and Hierarchy](../ghippo/user-guide/workspace/ws-folder.md).

The following uses MinIO as an example to introduce how to select a workspace, and the same applies to other data service components.

1. Select `Middleware` -> `MinIO Storage` in the left navigation bar.

     !!! note

         If the pop-up window does not appear / you want to switch the workspace, you can manually click the switch icon in the red box to select a new workspace.

3. When using it for the first time, you can click [`Deploy Now`](minio/user-guide/create.md) to create a MinIO instance.
