# Product advantage

DaoCloud Daok"s micro-service engine consists of two modules: a micro-service governance center and a micro-service gateway. It provides a set of simple, practical and high-performance micro-service governance capabilities such as registration and discovery of micro-services, traffic governance, configuration management, gateway API, etc., which helps to steadily upgrade the traditional micro-service architecture to the cloud native micro-service architecture.

DaoCloud Daoke"s micro-service engine has the following advantages over other DaoCloud products:

- One-stop management

    It provides service registration and discovery, configuration management, traffic governance, link tracking, metric monitoring, gateway management, API management, domain name management, alarm monitoring, gateway policy and other functions to meet the management requirements of each stage of the micro-service life cycle and achieve one-stop governance.

- Noninductive transfer

    Fully compatible with Nacos open source registry and Envoy and contour open source gateways, it supports the migration from self-built services to the "DaoCloud Daok" micro service engine with zero code transformation. Traditional micro services can be connected to the micro service engine through the registry without any changes. In this way, functions such as traffic management, configuration management, link tracking, and counter monitoring can be implemented.

- Smooth transition

    Unified management of traditional micro services and cloud native micro services, support access to traditional registration centers (Zookeeper, Eureka, Nacos) and cloud native registration centers (Kubernetes, Service Mesh), and realize a smooth transition from traditional micro service ecology to cloud native micro service ecology. Help enterprises to go to the cloud.

- Open and compatible

    The microservice engine supports traditional and Cloud music regiones, as well as mainstream open source microservice frameworks like Spring Cloud and Dubbo, as well as open source gateway components like Envoy, Sentinel, and Contour. In addition, it can also be freely combined with [DCE 5.0](../../dce/what.md) multi-cloud choreography, data service middleware, service mesh, App Workbench and other modules to achieve more customized and refined functions.

- Visual interface and data

    Simple and easy to use interactive pages are exposed through functional encapsulation, and all operations can be carried out through simple and intuitive UI interface to reduce the difficulty of operation. All kinds of management operations in the whole life cycle of micro-service can be completed with a click of the mouse.
