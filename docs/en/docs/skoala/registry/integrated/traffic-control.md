# Microservice governance

Microservice governance mainly refers to mesh service traffic governance based on Istio. The micro-service engine integrates the [Service Mesh](../../../mspider/intro/what.md) module of DCE 5.0, and supports mesh service governance through virtual service, target rule, and gateway rule.

!!! note

    - Only registries of the Mesh type support this feature.
    - Kubernetes/Zookeeper/Nacos/Eureka type of registry will not be shown in the left navigation bar `Microservice Governance` operation.

For more on micro-service governance, see [Service Mesh-->Traffic Governance](../../../mspider/user-guide/traffic-governance/README.md).
