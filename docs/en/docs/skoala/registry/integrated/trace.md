# link tracking

DCE 5.0 supports link tracking and query at the service level, checks the link delay distribution of each microservice, and can quickly locate the fault when a fault occurs.

For more details, please refer to [Observability-->Link Query](../../../insight/user-guide/04dataquery/tracequery.md).
