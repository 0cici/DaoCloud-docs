    The meanings of several option switches are:

    - Failed to delete: After enabling `Failed to delete`, the installation wait will be enabled synchronously by default. If the installation fails, delete related resources.
    - Ready Wait: When `Ready Wait` is enabled, the application will be marked as installed successfully after all associated resources created are in the ready state by default.
    - Detailed log: When enabled, the installation process log will be output in detail.

1. The system will automatically return to `Helm application`, the status is `not ready` at the beginning, and the status changes to `deployed` after a period of time, indicating that the insight-agent is installed successfully.
