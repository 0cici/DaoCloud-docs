# log query

Log query supports querying logs of nodes, events, and workloads, and can quickly query the required logs among a large number of logs. At the same time, it combines the source information of the logs and the original data of the context to assist in locating problems.

## prerequisites

- The cluster has [insight-agent installed](../../06UserGuide/01quickstart/installagent.md) and the application is in `running` state.
