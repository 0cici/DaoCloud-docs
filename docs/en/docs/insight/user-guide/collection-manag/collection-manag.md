# collection management

`Acquisition Management` is mainly to centrally manage and display the entrance of the cluster installation collection plug-in `insight-agent`, which helps users quickly view the health status of the cluster collection plug-in, and provides a quick entry to configure collection rules.

The specific operation steps are as follows:

1. Click in the upper left corner and select `Observability`.

    

2. Select `Acquisition Management` on the left navigation bar to view the status of all cluster collection plug-ins.

    

3. When the cluster is connected to `insight-agent` and is running, click `cluster name` to enter the details, click the shortcut link to jump to `container management` -> `custom resource` to add service discovery rules.
