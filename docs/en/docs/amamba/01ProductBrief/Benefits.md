# Advantage

"DaoCloud" relies on years of leading experience in the cloud-native field, and the newly developed application workbench has the following product advantages:

- Enterprise CI/CD

    Continuous development and continuous delivery using centrally managed containerized workflows that support horizontal scaling to support thousands of concurrent users and pipelines in a high availability (HA) environment.

- Cloud native as the base

    The application workbench implements containerized management of the application build environment, customizes resources such as build machines, ensures pipeline-level resource isolation, and supports multiple types of application deployment, making the delivery of cloud-native applications easier.

- Improve R&D efficiency

    In the visual pipeline construction environment, declarative steps are pre-packaged, and complex pipelines can be created without scripting, and the operation is simple. The environment can be automatically created/destroyed according to the resource size to avoid resource waste.

- Grayscale release

    Help users update applications incrementally, so as to ensure the smooth launch of new features. Supports application release strategies such as canary deployment and blue-green deployment.
  
    If the publishing policy of an application is configured as ABTest, and its A version access traffic is 80%, and B version access traffic is 20%, then it will be able to continuously access the two versions of the application after the gray scale release, and easily calculate the different versions of the application. split ratio.

- GitOps

    Provides Kubernetes-based declarative GitOps continuous delivery capabilities, and controls applications through versions to achieve automated application deployment and lifecycle management.
  
- [Pipeline as Code](../02QuickStart/deploypipline.md)

    The declarative (syntax)-based pipeline is easy to learn, the syntax of different steps is standardized, and its configuration is version-controllable, modular, reusable, and declarative.

- Comprehensive integration

    Integrate popular DevOps tools in the community. The steps in a single pipeline can run on multiple operating systems and multi-architecture nodes. It supports independent deployment on public clouds, private clouds or hosts, and can well integrate the company's own systems and platforms. .
    Supports the integration of mainstream software in the industry, such as Kubernetes, GitLab, SonarQube, Harbor, etc.

- Years of industry precipitation

    Working in the cloud native field for many years, hundreds of companies in finance, e-commerce, manufacturing and other industries have large-scale practical experience, can provide a stable and reliable IT delivery production line, and help companies build an integrated platform suitable for R&D and operation.
