# advantage

With years of leading experience in cloud native field, DaoCloud has developed a new application workbench with the following advantages:

- Enterprise CI/CD

    With centrally managed containerized workflows, continuous development, continuous delivery, and horizontal scaling, thousands of concurrent users and pipelines can be supported in a high availability (HA) environment.

- Cloud native is the base

    The application Workbench implements containerized management of application construction environments, customizes resources such as construction machines, ensures pipeline-level resource isolation, supports multiple types of application deployment, and simplifies the delivery of cloud native applications.

- Improve R&D efficiency

    Pre-packaging declarative steps in a visual pipeline build environment allows you to create a complex pipeline without scripting, making it easy to operate. You can automatically create/destroy environments based on resource size to avoid resource waste.

- Grayscale release

    Help users update applications gradually, so as to ensure the smooth launch of new features. Support Canary deployment, blue and green deployment and other application publishing strategies.
  
    If the release policy of an application is set to ABTest and the access traffic of version A is 80% and that of version B is 20%, the two versions of the application can be accessed continuously after being released in a gray scale, and the traffic flow ratio of different versions of the application can be easily calculated.

- GitOps

    Provides continuous delivery of declarative GitOps based on Kubernetes, enabling automated application deployment and lifecycle management through version control applications.
  
- [Pipeline is code](.. /quickstart/deploy-pipeline.md)

    Pipelinesbased on declarativity (syntax) are easy to learn, the syntax of different steps is standardized, and its configuration has the characteristics of versioncontrollable, modularized, reusable and declarative.

- Comprehensive integration

    Integration community popular DevOps tools, steps in a single pipeline can run on multiple operating systems, multiple architecture nodes, support independent deployment in the public cloud, private cloud or host, can be well integrated with the enterprise"s own systems and platforms. Supports integration of mainstream software in the industry, such as Kubernetes, GitLab, SonarQube, Harbor, etc.

- Multi-year industry precipitation

    He has worked in the field of cloud native for many years, and has large-scale practical experience in hundreds of enterprises in finance, e-commerce, manufacturing and other industries. He is able to provide stable and reliable IT delivery production line and help enterprises build an integrated platform suitable for R&D operation.
