# What is Container Management

Container management is a cloud-native container management platform for deploying and managing Kubernetes clusters. It is designed to simplify the process of enterprise application deployment to the cloud, reduce operational costs and improve management efficiency, and supports multicloud and hybrid cloud environments.

Some of the key features of container management include:

**Cluster Management**

- Unified management of clusters, supporting any Kubernetes cluster within a specific version range.
- Rapid deployment of clusters through the Web UI interface, adaptable to physical and virtual machines.
- One-click cluster upgrade with built-in disaster recovery and backup capabilities, ensuring business continuity.
- Full lifecycle management of clusters with OpenAPI capability.

**Application Management**

- One-stop deployment and operation of business applications with full lifecycle management capabilities.
- Elastic scaling of application load with support for horizontal, vertical, and scheduled scaling.
- Unified management across cluster loads.

**Strategy Management**

- Supports network policies, quota policies, resource limit policies, disaster recovery policies, and security policies.
- Network policy formulates communication rules between pods and network "entities" on the network plane.
- Quota policy limits resource usage of namespaces in the cluster.
- Resource limit policy constrains use of resources by applications in the corresponding namespace.
- Disaster recovery strategy realizes disaster recovery backup with namespace as the dimension, ensuring the security of the cluster.
- Security policy defines different isolation levels for Pods.
